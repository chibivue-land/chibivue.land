      "lore1": "Long ago, in the chaotic sea called the Internet, a pioneer appeared. His name was ubugeeei. He peered into the abyss of Vue.js and authored a tome called \"chibivue\" that unraveled its inner workings. This scripture guided many lost souls, and before long, those who shared his vision began to gather around him.",
      "lore2": "Thus was born chibivue.land. At first, it was merely a small domain for the book, but drawn by the virtue of King ubugeeei, people of all backgrounds naturally gathered, and it became a kingdom. A strange nation with no borders, no ranks—connected only by the simple desire to \"be here.\"",
      "lore3": "Yet at some point, the king vanished. He became a spirit king, a curse god, never to appear before mortals again. But fear not. Those whom the king appointed as aides during his lifetime carry on the founding spirit, preserving the kingdom's culture and history. They embody the king's will and warmly welcome new travelers.",
      "lore4": "The kingdom's symbol, \"kawaiko,\" reigns as one who watches over all. Despite the adorable appearance, kawaiko gazes upon the kingdom's fate with enlightened eyes. Under kawaiko's blessing, this kingdom breathes quietly yet surely, even today.",
